    - **nni_50**: Number of interval differences of successive RR-intervals greater than 50 ms.

    Details about feature engineering...

    - **total_power** : Total power density spectral

    - **vlf** : variance ( = power ) in HRV in the Very low Frequency (.003 to .04 Hz by default). \
    Reflect an intrinsic rhythm produced by the heart which is modulated primarily by sympathetic \
    activity.

    - **lf** : variance ( = power ) in HRV in the low Frequency (.04 to .15 Hz). Reflects a \
    mixture of sympathetic and parasympathetic activity, but in long-term recordings, it reflects \
    sympathetic activity and can be reduced by the beta-adrenergic antagonist propanolol.

    - **hf**: variance ( = power ) in HRV in the High Frequency (.15 to .40 Hz by default). \
    Reflects fast changes in beat-to-beat variability due to parasympathetic (vagal) activity. \
    Sometimes called the respiratory band because it corresponds to HRV changes related to the \
    respiratory cycle and can be increased by slow, deep breathing (about 6 or 7 breaths per \
    minute) and decreased by anticholinergic drugs or vagal blockade.

    - **lf_hf_ratio** : lf/hf ratio is sometimes used by some investigators as a quantitative \
    mirror of the sympatho/vagal balance.

    - **lfnu** : normalized lf power

    - **hfnu** : normalized hf power
